Baraha Bad Boys Mess is a sophisticated, minimalist mess management application designed for seamless tracking of member contributions and expenses. It features distinct dashboards for admins and members. Admins can initialize the monthly cycle, manage members, set contribution amounts, and oversee all financial activity. Members can log their expenses, view their personal balance, and track their spending history. The system provides real-time updates, dynamic calculation of balances, and generates detailed daily and monthly reports in Excel format. An integrated audit log captures key actions, including device information, ensuring transparency and accountability.

-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces that are shared between the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.
## Development Scripts
-   **`bun dev`**: Starts the development server with live reloading.
-   **`bun build`**: Builds the frontend application for production.
-   **`bun lint`**: Lints the codebase to check for errors and style issues.
